# NAME

App::Pinto - Command-line driver for Pinto

# VERSION

version 0.050

# DESCRIPTION

App::Pinto is the command-line driver for Pinto.  It is just a
front-end.  To do anything useful, you'll also need to install one of
the back-ends, which ship separately.  If you need to create
repositories and/or work directly with repositories on the local disk,
then install [Pinto](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Pinto).  If you already have a repository on a remote
host that is running [pintod](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?pintod), then install [Pinto::Remote](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Pinto::Remote).  If
you're not sure what you need, then install [Task::Pinto](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Task::Pinto) to get the
whole kit.
