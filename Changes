     !! DEVELOPER RELEASE !!

     This requires Pinto 0.065_03 (also a developer release).

     Still not compatible with any existing Pinto::Remote.

     The interface with the terminal has been completely redesigned.
     You'll see fewer (but hopefully better) diagnostic messages
     when running with --verbose.  And if not --verbose, then
     you'll see a progress meter.  If you still want to see all
     the gory details, then set the PINTO_DEBUG environment variable.

     Still works with any repository created with Pinto 0.065_01
     or later.  So no migration required for those.  For older
     repositories, see the IMPORTANT note down below under the 0.065_01 
     release.

0.065_01  2013-03-15 16:06:25 America/Los_Angeles

     !! DEVELOPER RELEASE !!

     This requires Pinto 0.065_01 (also a developer release).
     
     IMPORTANT:

     Bad news:  This version of pinto is not compatible with
     *existing* repositories.  To migrate, you'll need to create a new
     repository (using this version of pinto) and then "pull" all the
     distributons from your old repository into the new one.  Repeat
     this process for each stack.  Unfortunatley, you will loose your 
     revision history.  If you bug me about it, I'll write a script to 
     automate this for you.  I am thaljef@cpan.org.

     Good news:  This version of pinto has hooks to do future migrations 
     automatically.  So any repository you create with *this version* 
     of pinto can be easily migrated to any future versions. I'm also pretty 
     confident that the schema is now stable, so a migration will not be 
     required for a while.

     Also: several classes have been renamed or removed.  I strongly 
     recommend removing your current installation of Pinto and App::Pinto 
     before installing this one.  This will remove things that are no 
     longer supported.  


     COMMANDS:

     Many pinto commands have been been renamed, removed, or repurposed.
     Read the manual for each command to get full details.  Here is a
     summary of changes:
 
     New Commands:

     * The "props" command now shows AND sets configuration properties.
     The old "edit" command has been removed.

     * The new "default" command now takes the place of the --default
     option that existed on the (now defunct) "edit" command.  Use the
     "default" command to mark the default stack.  You can also choose
     to have no default stack in your repository, so that that every
     command will need to specify an explicit stack as an argument or
     option.

     * The new "kill" command takes the place of the "delete" command,
     which has been repurposed (see below).  The command also accepts
     a --force option which kills the stack even if it is locked.

     * The "delete" command has been repurposed to permanently remove
     an archive (and all of its history) from the repository.  This
     command is highly experimental.  Be sure to read the caveats in
     the manual for this command.

     * The new "lock" command locks a stack so that its packages
     cannot be changed by future commands.  This is useful for
     creating a read-only "tag" of a stack.  There is also an "unlock"
     command.

     * The new "migrate" command migrates existing repositories to be
     compatible with the current version of Pinto.  This will only
     work for repositories that were created with THIS version of
     Pinto or later.  Contact thaljef@cpan.org if you need to migrate
     an older repository.

     * The new "register" command registers the packages within an
     existing archive on a stack.  The archive must already be in the
     repository.

     * The new "unregister" command unregisters an archive from a stack,
     so that its packages will no longer appear in the index but the
     archive still remains in the repository.
     

     Changed Commands:

     * The --stack option on the "init" command are no longer supported.  
     Instead, you can specify the initial stack name as an argument.  Also
     the --bare option is not supported either.  When you create a repository
     with the "init" command the initial stack is now called "master".

     * The "copy" command no longer requires a commit message because
     the operation no longer creates an event in the revision history.

     * The "list" command no longer supports "%" to indicate that it should
     list the contents of all stacks.  Instead, use the "diff" command for 
     a more concise way to compare stacks. 

     * The "log" command no longer takes a revision argument ("dev@673")
     because revisions are no longer identified by a sequence number.  But  
     a similar feature will be avialable in the next release.  Also, the
     --details opton is not supported any more, but it will probably come
     back in the next release.

     * The --norecurse and --dryrun options have been renamed to --no-recurse
     and --dry-run on all commands that support them.  This is to be consistent 
     with other multi-word option names.


     Removed Commands:

     * The "merge" and "revert" commands have been removed.  At this time
     it just isn't clear how they should behave or even what their use case
     is.  When I know more, I may bring these back.

     * The "edit" command is also gone.  It's functionality has been
     replaced with the "props" command (see above).

     * The "blame" command has been removed.  It never worked in the first
     place and fixing it is a low priority right now.


     ENHANCEMENTS:

     * The version control system within Pinto has been redesigned to be
     simpler and faster.  It is more Git-like and stores full snapshots of
     the stack at each revision (rather than just storing deltas).  It also
     organizes history into a directed graph and uses unique non-sequential
     identifiers for each revision.

     * Due to the new version control system, the performance and scalability
     of Pinto is much improved.  Benchmark tests show that common operations still
     perform well with as many as 10,000 commits (I estimate that is 10 years of
     work).  And a Pinto repository can scale to 100,000 distributions with good 
     performance too (that's almost all of CPAN).

     * The output of several commands are now colorized to improve readability.
     Use the --no-color option or set PINTO_NO_COLOR to disable color
     globally.




0.054     2012-11-12 13:22:33 America/Los_Angeles

     New Commands:

     * The "rename" command allows you to change the name of an
     existing stack.  Say 'pinto manual rename' for details. This
     requires Pinto-0.063 or later.

     New Features:

     * Commands that support the --message option also now have a
     --use-default-message (or -M) option, which causes pinto to use
     the default log message that it generates for each command.  This
     saves you the trouble of having to save and close the default
     message in your text editor.  Requires Pinto-0.062 or later.
 
0.053     2012-10-22 12:39:01 America/Los_Angeles

     The 'new' and 'copy' commands now have a '--default' option for
     setting the default stack at the same time.  This is most useful
     for setting the default stack after creating a new stack in a
     bare repository.

0.052     2012-10-20 00:00:34 America/Los_Angeles

     Added the 'blame' command, which shows who was the last person
     to modify a package in the stack (by either adding, pinning,
     or unpinning it).  Requires Pinto-0.059 or later.

     Stack names and property names are no longer forced to lower-case.
     Instead, the case will be preserved but any lookups or comparisons
     will not be case sensitive.

0.051     2012-09-27 13:46:59 America/Los_Angeles

     Added the 'replace' command, which substitutes one distribution
     for another across all stacks (Contributed by renormalist).
     You'll need to upgrade Pinto to use this command.

0.050     2012-09-20 13:19:38 America/Los_Angeles

     For the 'list' command, the magic all-stack name has been changed
     from '@' to '%'.  This was done to distinguish it from revisions,
     which look like 'stack@1234'.  Requires Pinto-0.055 for
     compatibility.

0.049     2012-09-19 22:04:59 America/Los_Angeles

     Added --dryrun option to committable commands.  This was already
     supported by Pinto.  It just wasn't offered here in the command
     line.

0.048     2012-09-18 16:07:04 America/Los_Angeles

     Now requires Pinto-0.52 or newer, if using local repositories.
     For remote repositories, App::Pinto should still work with your
     current version of Pinto::Remote.  However, you'll need to
     upgrade Pinto and Pinto::Server on the remote host to use the new
     commands (listed below).

     Added the 'revert' command, which resores the stack to a revision
     of your choosing.  See POD for detais.

     Added the 'log' command, which shows the changes that have
     happened on a stack.

     The --dryrun option is available (again) on all commands that
     change the state of the repository.

     All commands that affect the state of the repository now require
     a commit message.

0.047     2012-08-28 15:48:00 America/Los_Angeles

     The 'index' command is no longer supported.  With the latest
     versions of Pinto and Pinto::Server, this command is no longer
     useful.

     The --dryrun option is only supported on the add, pull, and merge
     commands.  It didn't make much sense on other commands.

0.045     2012-08-16 11:47:51 America/Los_Angeles
     
     Just documentaiton edits.  No code changes.

0.044     2012-08-15 18:25:05 America/Los_Angeles

     Added a 'clean' command to force removal of orphaned
     archives on the filesystem.  See POD for details.  You'll
     need to have Pinto-0.051 installed locally (or on the server,
     if using a remote repository) to use this new command.

0.043     2012-08-14 14:53:41 America/Los_Angeles

     Added global options for username and password.  These only
     matter if using a remote repository that has authentication
     enabled.

0.042     2012-05-18 16:37:10 America/Los_Angeles

     * Bug Fixes

     The init command did not honor the PINTO_REPOSITORY_ROOT
     environment variable.  Thanks fibo.

0.041     2012-05-15 11:09:56 America/Los_Angeles

     First production release.  The included pinto utility replaces
     both the pinto-admin and pinto-remote utilities.  However, you
     still have to decide which backend to install (either Pinto or
     Pinto::Remote) which ship separately from this distribution.

0.040_02  2012-05-04 15:37:34 America/Los_Angeles

     Iniital developer release.
