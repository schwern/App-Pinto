     Added the 'replace' command, which substitutes one distribution
     for another across all stacks (Contributed by renormalist).
     You'll need to upgrade Pinto to use this command.

     For the 'list' command, the magic all-stack name has been changed
     from '@' to '%'.  This was done to distinguish it from revisions,
     which look like 'stack@1234'.  Requires Pinto-0.055 for
     compatibility.

     Added --dryrun option to committable commands.  This was already
     supported by Pinto.  It just wasn't offered here in the command
     line.

     Now requires Pinto-0.52 or newer, if using local repositories.
     For remote repositories, App::Pinto should still work with your
     current version of Pinto::Remote.  However, you'll need to
     upgrade Pinto and Pinto::Server on the remote host to use the new
     commands (listed below).

     Added the 'revert' command, which resores the stack to a revision
     of your choosing.  See POD for detais.

     Added the 'log' command, which shows the changes that have
     happened on a stack.

     The --dryrun option is available (again) on all commands that
     change the state of the repository.

     All commands that affect the state of the repository now require
     a commit message.

     The 'index' command is no longer supported.  With the latest
     versions of Pinto and Pinto::Server, this command is no longer
     useful.

     The --dryrun option is only supported on the add, pull, and merge
     commands.  It didn't make much sense on other commands.

     Just documentaiton edits.  No code changes.

0.044     2012-08-15 18:25:05 America/Los_Angeles

     Added a 'clean' command to force removal of orphaned
     archives on the filesystem.  See POD for details.  You'll
     need to have Pinto-0.051 installed locally (or on the server,
     if using a remote repository) to use this new command.

0.043     2012-08-14 14:53:41 America/Los_Angeles

     Added global options for username and password.  These only
     matter if using a remote repository that has authentication
     enabled.

     * Bug Fixes

     The init command did not honor the PINTO_REPOSITORY_ROOT
     environment variable.  Thanks fibo.

     First production release.  The included pinto utility replaces
     both the pinto-admin and pinto-remote utilities.  However, you
     still have to decide which backend to install (either Pinto or
     Pinto::Remote) which ship separately from this distribution.

0.040_02  2012-05-04 15:37:34 America/Los_Angeles

     Iniital developer release.
