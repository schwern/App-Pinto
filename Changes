     IMPORTANT:

     This release requires a new version of Pinto (either locally or
     on the remote server) which is not compatible with repositories
     that were created with older versions.  If you need have an older
     repository, please contact thaljef@cpan.org to discuss a
     migration plan.

     Also, several commands have been added and/or renamed.  I strongly
     suggest that you remove your current installation of App::Pinto
     and Pinto before installing.  This will remove old commands that
     are not supported any more.
 
     New Commands:

     * The "props" and "edit" command have been unified into a new
     "config" command that both shows and sets configuration
     properties (like Git).

     * The new "default" command now takes the place of the --default
     option that existed on the (now defunct) "edit" command.  Use the
     "default" command to mark the default stack.  You can also choose
     to have no default stack in your repository, so that that every
     command will need to specify an explicit stack as an argument or
     option.

     * The new "kill" command takes the place of the "delete" command,
     which has been repurposed (see below).  The command also accepts
     a --force option which kills the stack even if it is locked.

     * The "delete" command has been repurposed to permanently remove
     an archive (and all of it's history) from the repository.  This
     command is highly experimental.  Be sure to read the caveats in
     the manual for this command.

     * The new "lock" command locks a stack so that its packages
     cannot be changed by future commands.  This is useful for
     creating a read-only "tag" of a stack.

     * The new "unlock" command unlocks a stack so that you can
     modify its packages.

     * The new "migrate" command migrates existing repositories to be
     compatible with the current version of Pinto.  This will only
     work for repositories that were created with THIS version of
     Pinto or later.  Contact thaljef@cpan.org if you need to migrate
     an older repository.

     * The new "reindex" command reregisters the packages within an
     existing archive on a stack.  The archive must already be in the
     repository.  At present, it does not recurse into dependencies,
     but it might in the future.

     * The new "pop" command unregisters an archive from a stack, so
     that its packages will no longer appear in the index but the
     archive still remains in the repository.  The --force option
     will permit you to unregister packages even if they are pinned.
     

     Interface Changes:

     * The --bare and --stack options on the "init" command are no
     longer supported.  Instead, you can specify the initial stack
     name as an argument.  If you do not specify the stack name, then
     you get a bare repository.  You can also choose whether the
     initial stack is marked as the default or not.

     * Stack and repository configuration properties are once again
     forced to lowercase.  After some debate, I decided that this
     was just more user-friendly.  However, stack names are still
     case-preserving but case-insensitive.

     * The "copy" command no longer requires a commit message because
     the operation no longer creates an event in the revision history.

     New Commands:

     * The "rename" command allows you to change the name of an
     existing stack.  Say 'pinto manual rename' for details. This
     requires Pinto-0.063 or later.

     New Features:

     * Commands that support the --message option also now have a
     --use-default-message (or -M) option, which causes Pinto to use
     the default log message that it generates for each command.  This
     saves you the trouble of having to save and close the default
     message in your text editor.  Requires Pinto-0.062 or later.
 
0.053     2012-10-22 12:39:01 America/Los_Angeles

     The 'new' and 'copy' commands now have a '--default' option for
     setting the default stack at the same time.  This is most useful
     for setting the default stack after creating a new stack in a
     bare repository.

0.052     2012-10-20 00:00:34 America/Los_Angeles

     Added the 'blame' command, which shows who was the last person
     to modify a package in the stack (by either adding, pinning,
     or unpinning it).  Requires Pinto-0.059 or later.

     Stack names and property names are no longer forced to lower-case.
     Instead, the case will be preserved but any lookups or comparisons
     will not be case sensitive.

0.051     2012-09-27 13:46:59 America/Los_Angeles

     Added the 'replace' command, which substitutes one distribution
     for another across all stacks (Contributed by renormalist).
     You'll need to upgrade Pinto to use this command.

0.050     2012-09-20 13:19:38 America/Los_Angeles

     For the 'list' command, the magic all-stack name has been changed
     from '@' to '%'.  This was done to distinguish it from revisions,
     which look like 'stack@1234'.  Requires Pinto-0.055 for
     compatibility.

0.049     2012-09-19 22:04:59 America/Los_Angeles

     Added --dryrun option to committable commands.  This was already
     supported by Pinto.  It just wasn't offered here in the command
     line.

0.048     2012-09-18 16:07:04 America/Los_Angeles

     Now requires Pinto-0.52 or newer, if using local repositories.
     For remote repositories, App::Pinto should still work with your
     current version of Pinto::Remote.  However, you'll need to
     upgrade Pinto and Pinto::Server on the remote host to use the new
     commands (listed below).

     Added the 'revert' command, which resores the stack to a revision
     of your choosing.  See POD for detais.

     Added the 'log' command, which shows the changes that have
     happened on a stack.

     The --dryrun option is available (again) on all commands that
     change the state of the repository.

     All commands that affect the state of the repository now require
     a commit message.

0.047     2012-08-28 15:48:00 America/Los_Angeles

     The 'index' command is no longer supported.  With the latest
     versions of Pinto and Pinto::Server, this command is no longer
     useful.

     The --dryrun option is only supported on the add, pull, and merge
     commands.  It didn't make much sense on other commands.

0.045     2012-08-16 11:47:51 America/Los_Angeles
     
     Just documentaiton edits.  No code changes.

0.044     2012-08-15 18:25:05 America/Los_Angeles

     Added a 'clean' command to force removal of orphaned
     archives on the filesystem.  See POD for details.  You'll
     need to have Pinto-0.051 installed locally (or on the server,
     if using a remote repository) to use this new command.

0.043     2012-08-14 14:53:41 America/Los_Angeles

     Added global options for username and password.  These only
     matter if using a remote repository that has authentication
     enabled.

0.042     2012-05-18 16:37:10 America/Los_Angeles

     * Bug Fixes

     The init command did not honor the PINTO_REPOSITORY_ROOT
     environment variable.  Thanks fibo.

0.041     2012-05-15 11:09:56 America/Los_Angeles

     First production release.  The included pinto utility replaces
     both the pinto-admin and pinto-remote utilities.  However, you
     still have to decide which backend to install (either Pinto or
     Pinto::Remote) which ship separately from this distribution.

0.040_02  2012-05-04 15:37:34 America/Los_Angeles

     Iniital developer release.
